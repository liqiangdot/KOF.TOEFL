## 前 言

准备托福考试的过程中，最为头痛的可能就是作文的准备了。大多数考生明明知道作文成绩非常重要，也每天为此焦急万分，可是看着考试日期慢慢逼近，却偏偏不知所措，到了考试那天才发现自己竟然连一篇作文都没有准备过！

然而，作文部分是最没有理由拿不到高分的。因为，这是一个事先知道考题的作文考试！目前ETS官方发布的题库中有185道题目，而每次的考题都来自于题库，并且保证原封不动！（注意：2006年8月之后，TOEFL® iBT 中的写作分为两部分，综合写作测试以及独立写作测试；而其中的独立写作测试部分依然使用这套题库。）换言之，这是一个几乎可以做到考前百分之百准备的考试，有什么理由不得满分呢?

有些考生并不知道题库的存在，准备考试时犹如无头苍蝇，终日乱打乱撞，最终惨败于考场，这并不奇怪。奇怪的是，很多考生明明清楚题库的存在，却在考场上依然惨败。究其原因，无非是方法不得当、做了很多无用功的缘故。凡事都要讲究方法，方法得当可以事半功倍，方法不当往往事倍功半，更可能付出了很多努力却落得竹篮打水一场空。

最重要的是：获得写作高分**不能依靠临场发挥**。

有些人这样计划考试时间：考场上一共有30分钟写作文，其中5分钟审题，10分钟打草稿，10分钟誊写，5分钟检查语法错误。这看起来是个不错的计划，然而彻头彻尾地行不通，因为30分钟时间根本不够。不用说让一个普通考生用30分钟写一篇英文作文，就是让他用30分钟抄写一篇300～350词的英语文章都可能时间不够！真正考过一次就知道了，30分钟有多么紧张。所以，在考场上审题是很不现实的。实际上，ETS的题库是完全公开的，为什么不在考前完成所有的审题工作呢？不仅审题工作可以在考前完成，甚至进一步说，事实上，所有的工作都可以在考前完成。

有些考生是非常凶悍的——干脆把题库中的题目全都写了一遍，这样的人有什么理由得不了高分呢？然而不是所有的人都如此凶悍，也不是所有凶悍的人都有那么多的时间和精力。毕竟大多数考生希望能够在3～6个月之间搞定托福考试，因为还有很多其他的事等着他们呢。不要以为时间不够用，只要方法得当，时间还是非常充裕的。

首先，要明白只列大纲是没有意义的。很多考生所谓的准备方法不过是列列大纲，背背模板，然后冲进考场才发现自己的无力和无助。列出来的大纲往往只不过三五句话，只占整个篇幅的1/5不到，其他的4/5实际上也可以事先准备啊！所以，我的建议是：不仅列大纲，还要落实到具体细节，然后去查词典！我很奇怪有些人上考场之前从来没有查过词典，凭什么奢望自己可以获得高分呢？

第二，最初练习的时候不要限定时间。没有人从一开始就可以在30分钟之内轻松地用第二语言写出漂亮的文章。有些考生不明就里，一上来就随机抽取一道题目，然后限时30分钟写一篇作文，并且强迫自己不查词典。于是写出来的文章必然惨不忍睹。其实，第一篇可以用很长时间完成。正常人总会通过练习不断进步的。如果第一篇用N个小时完成，我相信第二篇一定会快一点的，比如用N-1个小时。据观察，一个普通的考生，不限时练习20～30篇之后，都可以做到30分钟内写出比较不错的文章。

第三，如果基础稍微薄弱一些的话，最初的时候不应该创作文章，而是改写文章。正如在练字和学画的时候，我们第一步要临摹一样，我们可以从改写文章开始。一般情况下，改写10～20篇，就能体会到巨大的进步。这个时候已经初步把握一些思维套路，一定数量的表达句型以及相当数量的针对性很强的常用词汇。打下这样的基础，再开始练习独立创作就相对容易了。改写文章，可以从以下几个方面入手：

* 尝试替换某个词汇
* 尝试替换某个句型
* 尝试替换某个例子
* 尝试替换某个理由
* 尝试换一种说法
* 尝试表述对立的观点

方法说起来很简单，操作起来没那么容易。很多时候，我们会发现即便是一个粗略的计划也要比没有计划有效得多。以下是一个简单的6周高分写作准备计划，读者可以酌情修改，而后贯彻实施。

* 第一阶段(1周)：随机阅读10～15篇范文，每天2～3篇。做笔记，背诵其中有用的词汇以及句型。
* 第二阶段(2周)：改写10～20篇范文。每天1～2篇。每天睡觉前背诵当天改写过的作文。这个阶段没必要限定每篇完成的时间。
* 第三阶段(1周)：不限时练习5～10篇，每天1～2篇。一定要不限时，这样才能保证质量。多查词典，反复修改。如果时间充裕，应*该多练5～10篇。
* 第四阶段(2周)：限时练习10篇，每天练习一次，每次限时25分钟完成——只有这样才能在考场上游刃有余。注意：完成之后，有时间的话可以反复修改。最重要的是，睡觉之前，把当天的作文背诵下来，并且在第二天做默写练习。

最后说明一点，为了方便读者检索，编者为英文范文和中文译文一一加上了标题，在实际考试中考生是不需要给出文章标题的。
